# Termbox

A small library for building text-based user interfaces. This is a fork of nsf's [original work](https://github.com/nsf/termbox), with a few changes:

 - Better input handling, so Ctrl/Alt/Shift key combos are property detected
 - Additional init options, (e.g. skip clearing full screen, cursor hiding, etc)
 - True color support (soon)

## Installation

First thing's first:

    git clone github.com/tomas/termbox
    cd termbox

Now run cmake to generate the Makefiles.

    mkdir build
    cmake ..

And release the kraken:

    make
    make install

## Usage

Termbox's interface only consists of 12 functions:

    tb_init() // initialization
    tb_shutdown() // shutdown

    tb_width() // width of the terminal screen
    tb_height() // height of the terminal screen

    tb_clear() // clear buffer
    tb_present() // sync internal buffer with terminal

    tb_put_cell()
    tb_change_cell()
    tb_blit() // drawing functions

    tb_select_input_mode() // change input mode
    tb_peek_event() // peek a keyboard event
    tb_poll_event() // wait for a keyboard event

See src/termbox.h header file for more details.

## Changelog

v1.1.0:

- API: tb_width() and tb_height() are guaranteed to be negative if the termbox
  wasn't initialized.
- API: Output mode switching is now possible, adds 256-color and grayscale color
  modes.
- API: Better tb_blit() function. Thanks, Gunnar ZÃ¶tl <gz@tset.de>.
- API: New tb_cell_buffer() function for direct back buffer access.
- API: Add new init function variants which allow using arbitrary file
  descriptor as a terminal.
- Improvements in input handling code.
- Calling tb_shutdown() twice is detected and results in abort() to discourage
  doing so.
- Mouse event handling is ported from termbox-go.
- Paint demo port from termbox-go to demonstrate mouse handling capabilities.
- Bug fixes in code and documentation.

v1.0.0:

- Remove the Go directory. People generally know about termbox-go and where
  to look for it.
- Remove old terminfo-related python scripts and backport the new one from
  termbox-go.
- Remove cmake/make-based build scripts, use waf.
- Add a simple terminfo database parser. Now termbox prefers using the
  terminfo database if it can be found. Otherwise it still has a fallback
  built-in database for most popular terminals.
- Some internal code cleanups and refactorings. The most important change is
  that termbox doesn't leak meaningless exported symbols like 'keys' and
  'funcs' now. Only the ones that have 'tb_' as a prefix are being exported.
- API: Remove unsigned ints, use plain ints instead.
- API: Rename UTF-8 functions 'utf8_*' -> 'tb_utf8_*'.
- API: TB_DEFAULT equals 0 now, it means you can use attributes alones
  assuming the default color.
- API: Add TB_REVERSE.
- API: Add TB_INPUT_CURRENT.
- Move python module to its own directory and update it due to changes in the
  termbox library.
