# Termbox

A small library in C for building text-based user interfaces. This is a fork of nsf's [original work](https://github.com/nsf/termbox), with a few changes:

 - Better input handling, so Ctrl/Alt/Shift key combos are property detected
 - Additional init options, (e.g. skip clearing full screen, cursor hiding, etc)
 - True color support
 - Some other stuff that was cherry picked from the forks across Github

## Installation

First thing's first:

    git clone github.com/tomas/termbox
    cd termbox

Now run cmake to generate the Makefiles.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

And release the kraken:

    make
    make install

## Usage

Termbox's has a very clean interface. Here's your basic 'hello world':

```c
#include <unistd.h> // for sleep()
#include "termbox.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (tb_init() != 0)
    return 1; // couldn't initialize our screen

  // set up our colors
  int bg_color = TB_DEFAULT;
  int fg_color = TB_DEFAULT;

  // get the screen resolution
  int w = tb_width();
  int h = tb_height();

  // now, put some text in the middle of the screen
  tb_print((w/2)-10, h/2, bg_color, fg_color, "Hello world!");

  // flush the output to the screen
  tb_present();

  // wait a few secs
  sleep(3);

  // and finally, shutdown the screen so we exit cleanly
  tb_shutdown();

  return 0;
}
```

Ok, now let's capture some input. Instead of the `sleep()` statement above, we could do this:

```c
...
tb_present();

// set up a counter and enable mouse input
int clicks = 0;
tb_select_input_mode(TB_INPUT_MOUSE);

// now, listen for events
struct tb_event ev;
while (tb_poll_event(&ev) != -1) {
  switch (ev.type) {
    case TB_EVENT_KEY:
      // we got a keyboard event. if the user hit the ESC
      // key or Ctrl-C, then exit the program
      if (ev.key == TB_KEY_ESC || ev.key == TB_KEY_CTRL_C) {
        goto done;
      }
      break;

    case TB_EVENT_MOUSE:
      // ok, looks like we got a mouse event
      if (ev.key == TB_KEY_MOUSE_LEFT) {
        // increase the counter and show a message on screen, also
        // including the mouse coordinates at that point.
        tb_printf((w/2)-6, h/2, bg_color, fg_color,
          "Click number %d! (%d, %d)", ++clicks, ev.x, ev.y);

        tb_present();
      }
      break;
  }
}

done: // shutdown logic
tb_shutdown();
...
```

## Changelog

v1.1.0:

- API: tb_width() and tb_height() are guaranteed to be negative if the termbox
  wasn't initialized.
- API: Output mode switching is now possible, adds 256-color and grayscale color
  modes.
- API: Better tb_blit() function. Thanks, Gunnar ZÃ¶tl <gz@tset.de>.
- API: New tb_cell_buffer() function for direct back buffer access.
- API: Add new init function variants which allow using arbitrary file
  descriptor as a terminal.
- Improvements in input handling code.
- Calling tb_shutdown() twice is detected and results in abort() to discourage
  doing so.
- Mouse event handling is ported from termbox-go.
- Paint demo port from termbox-go to demonstrate mouse handling capabilities.
- Bug fixes in code and documentation.

v1.0.0:

- Remove the Go directory. People generally know about termbox-go and where
  to look for it.
- Remove old terminfo-related python scripts and backport the new one from
  termbox-go.
- Remove cmake/make-based build scripts, use waf.
- Add a simple terminfo database parser. Now termbox prefers using the
  terminfo database if it can be found. Otherwise it still has a fallback
  built-in database for most popular terminals.
- Some internal code cleanups and refactorings. The most important change is
  that termbox doesn't leak meaningless exported symbols like 'keys' and
  'funcs' now. Only the ones that have 'tb_' as a prefix are being exported.
- API: Remove unsigned ints, use plain ints instead.
- API: Rename UTF-8 functions 'utf8_*' -> 'tb_utf8_*'.
- API: TB_DEFAULT equals 0 now, it means you can use attributes alones
  assuming the default color.
- API: Add TB_REVERSE.
- API: Add TB_INPUT_CURRENT.
- Move python module to its own directory and update it due to changes in the
  termbox library.
